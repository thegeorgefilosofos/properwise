- **Erasure**: **delete account** (`delete_my_account`, cascades to owned data).
- **Rectification**: in-app editing across all records.
- **Objection / opt-out**: per-message unsubscribe; marketing gated behind `email_marketing_prefs`.

## International transfers
US subprocessors (Resend, Anthropic, GitHub, Creem) under **SCCs**; system of
record stays in the EU. See `subprocessors.md`.
